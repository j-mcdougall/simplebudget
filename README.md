Why Simple Budget?

Simple Budget was created out of a frustration of trying to find a simple “envelope” method budgeting program that would carry over from month to month. From simple to elaborate, I could not find something that suits my needs so I created Simple Budget.

Simple Budget was written because I wanted a very simple way of keeping track of my expenses and savings from month to month.

Here is a list of NON-features:\
– It does not have any bells and whistles.\
– It does not encrypt its data file.\
– It does not access the Internet.\
– You can not access it on-line.\
– There is no smartphone app for it.\
– It does not display ads.\
– And it does not spy on you.\

What it does do:\
– Keeps track of your spending.\
– Allows you to track your saving for a budget fund month to month\
– It is easy.\
– It is free. Use at your own risk, It is a work in progress.\

I created Simple Budget for my own use.  If you find bugs, I would love to know about them. If you have an idea for a feature or a suggestion of how to do something better, I welcome it.  I created Simple Budget for myself,  and decided maybe someone else could benefit from it also. If you want to troll me, go write your own program.
