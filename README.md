Why Simple Budget?

Simple Budget was created out of a frustration of trying to find a simple “envelope” method budgeting program that would carry over from month to month. From simple to elaborate, I could not find something that suits my needs so I created Simple Budget.

Simple Budget was written because I wanted a very simple way of keeping track of my expenses and savings from month to month.

Here is a list of NON-features:\
– It does not have any bells and whistles.\
– It is not “internationalized” and uses the “$”.\
– Since I wrote if for myself, it is in “English”.\
– It does not encrypt its data file.\
– It does not access the Internet.\
– You can not access it on-line.\
– There is no smartphone app for it.\
– It does not display ads.\
– And it does not spy on you.\

What it does do:\
– Keeps track of your spending.\
– Allows you to track your saving for a budget fund month to month\
– It is easy.\
– It is free. Use at your own risk, It is a work in progress.\

I created Simple Budget for my own use.  If you find bugs, I would love to know about them. If you have an idea for a feature or a suggestion of how to do something better, I welcome it.  I created Simple Budget for myself,  and decided maybe someone else could benefit from it also. If you want to troll me, go write your own program.

## Linux

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-white.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/simplebudget)
- If you can not print the reports, run the following command in a terminal session:
- sudo snap connect simplebudget:cups-control :cups-control

## Windows

Download the installation program and run it.  The install program will ask you where you want the files.  Select a folder where you would like them to go.  Run "simplebudget.exe" from that folder.  The first time Simple Budget is ran, it will create a data folder named "simplebudget" under the user's profile directory.
